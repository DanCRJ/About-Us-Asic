          <p>Asia Source iCollege was established on November 27, 2013 under the leadership of Mr. Fernando G. Dulce. The school is on its present location at the 4th Floor of Gate 3 Plaza, along Lawton Avenue corner Juliano Ave in AFPOVAI Phase III, Western Bicutan, Taguig City. The School's guiding principle is communicated in its motto, “Your Success is our Goal.”</p>
        <br>
          <p>“Your success is our goal” has been the mantra of Asia Source iCollege aspiring to be the Asia’s best in the fields of arts and technology.</p>
        <br>
          <p>A relatively new school, Asia Source is abreast with other top institutions and remarkably exceeds expectations of a new school in providing quality education relevant with the needs of the times through its top of the line facilities, highly-qualified educators, and government-approved instructional content validated by the seal of recognition and certification by both the Department of Education (DepEd) and Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA).
            The school offers Short Courses, Assessment and Scholarship programs under TESDA since 2014 while Senior High School programs started on June 2016 under Department of Education.</p>
        <br>
          <p>A second branch was opened at Kapasigan, Pasig City on January 23, 2018 offering the same courses we have in Taguig City.</p>
        <br>
          <p>Asia Source iCollege offers a very low investment to help the students finish a technical–vocational and senior-high school programs with ease but promises a great and successful future ahead of them.
            Success comes to those who become success conscious, who are busy looking for it and those who dare to dream. We at Asia Source’s goal is to make you become successful in life not just by preparing for job opportunities but also an entrepreneur through partnership with top-rank companies.</p>
